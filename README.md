# Keygen.sh  | PHP | Software Development Kit
Keygen.sh does not have a PHP Software Development Kit (SDK) that works with their API.  So I made one.  I had a client that is using their service as a authentication process.  That being said it was needed and they were lacking so there we are.  =)  

## Expectation
I prepared a half way put together SDK for a client previously.  However I am back to finish the job.  I will reuse any code that I am able to, however the main components "User, Policy, License, Machine etc objects will be re-built.  They were not exactly what I was looking for.  

## Goals
These are just a couple of the basic project material needed to get this project really moving in the correct direction.
